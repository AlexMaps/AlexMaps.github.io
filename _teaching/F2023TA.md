As a teaching assistant for GEOG*2420 The Earth From Space, I guided students through lab exercises in QGIS and was responsible for grading their lab work. The lab topics I covered included: visualizing multispectral imagery, creating spectral indices, georeferencing air photos and creating flood maps from SAR imagery.
