My name is Alexander Johnston, I am a Master's student at the University of Guelph in the Geography Department. My research is on mapping of heathland habitats and disturbance histories within the Miawpukek First Nations (MFN) Traditional Territory. My primary research objectives are to develop a model to classify heathlands in MFN Traditional Territory and to explore the relationship between historic disturbances and comtempoary heathland distribution. 


Current Projects
======
I am currently building a Random Forest model to heathlands in MFN Traditional Territory. This summer I will be gathering ground truth poitns for validation and calibration of my model. In addition to heathland detection my research seeks to explore the factors influencing primary succession of heathlands at the landscape levelâ€”a dimension that has not been extensively studied.

Past Projects
======
**Comparing Pixel and Object-Based Classification of Heathland in Central Newfoundland using Random Forest Classifier**

**Comparing Sentinel 2, SAR and Terrain Data Composites for Heathland Classification in Conne River using Random Forest Classifier**

**Impacts of Potential Rail Crossing Closures on Active Transportation in Guelph, Ontario**

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
