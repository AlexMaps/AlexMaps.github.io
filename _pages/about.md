My name is Alexander Johnston, I am a Master's student at the University of Guelph in the Geography Department. My research is on mapping of heathland habitats and disturbance histories within the Miawpukek First Nations (MFN) Traditional Territory. My primary research objectives are to develop a model to classify heathlands in MFN Traditional Territory and to explore the relationship between historic disturbances and comtempoary heathland distribution. 


Current Projects
======
I am currently building a Random Forest model to heathlands in MFN Traditional Territory. This summer I will be gathering ground truth poitns for validation and calibration of my model. In addition to heathland detection my research seeks to explore the factors influencing primary succession of heathlands at the landscape levelâ€”a dimension that has not been extensively studied.
