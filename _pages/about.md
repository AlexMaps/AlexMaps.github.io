My name is Alexander Johnston, I am a Master's student at the University of Guelph in the Geography Department. My research is on mapping of heathland habitats and disturbance histories within the Miawpukek First Nations (MFN) Traditional Territory. My primary research objective is to investigate the dynamics between forest and heathland ecosystems, focusing the post disturbance sucession and its implications for forest management and conservation practices

Current Projects
======
I've created a land cover map of heathlands, wetlands, and forests for MFN traditional territory. I am currently constructing a post-fire succession detection model using burn severity and the slope of log-transformed spectral indices.

Past Projects
======

**Comparing Pixel and Object-Based Classification of Heathland in Central Newfoundland using Random Forest Classifier**

This project compared pixel-based and object-based random forest classification of landcover. Both methods achieved high accuracies, with the pixel-based model generally outperforming the object-based approach, though the latter provided benefits like noise reduction and enhanced ecological insights through landscape pattern analysis.

**Comparing Sentinel 2, SAR and Terrain Data Composites for Heathland Classification in Conne River using Random Forest Classifier**

For this preliminary study I assesed how the integration of various data source impacted the accuracies of heathland classification models. The standalone spectral data achieved an overall accuracy of 94.63%. The inclusion of terrain and SAR data resulted in a marginal increase, raising the overall accuracy to 95.12%.

**Impacts of Potential Rail Crossing Closures on Active Transportation in Guelph, Ontario**

For this capstone project my group assessed the impacts of rail crossing closure(s) on active transportation users and routes in Guelph for the Guelph Coalition for Active Transportation (GCAT). Using ArcGIS Proâ€™s Network Analyst and statistical paired t-test analysis we identified the impacts to 5 crossings with the city. While closures had a minimal impact on pedestrian and cyclist travel times and distances, they often forced cyclists and pedestrians to take more dangerous routes such as those without more lanes and higher speeds.
