At CSRS 2025, I shared my research on post-fire vegetation dynamics in Newfoundland, demonstrating how Landsat time series can be used to detect forest-to-heathland state shifts across the boreal landscape. I highlighted divergent sucession pathways after wildfire have unique spectral time series signatures which we can use to help us understand where and why forest recover or shift state. During the conference, I connected with researchers and professionals working on wildfire and vegetation recovery, leading to valuable conversations about monitoring landscape change in a warming climate.
