In this presentation, I showcased my classification model and preliminary post-disturbance sucession detection model. Focusing on Miawpukek First Nationâ€™s traditional territory, the landcover model utilizes Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, environmental variables, and a Random Forest model to produce the region's first heathland classification. Ground validation points and observations from the field in Summer 2024 revealed that the landcover in the study area are less discrete than previously assumed, complicating predictive modeling. Forests, heathlands, and wetlands exhibit transitional zones, with some areas showing characteristics of multiple landcover types. By integrating a time series analysis, I demonstrate how four years of satellite data was able to predict post disturbance forest and heathland succession. Tasseled cap wetness index and differential normalized burn ratio were high importance variables in the model, suggesting that brun severity and water availability may play a role in post fire sucession.
